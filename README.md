# TimeSeriesForecasting

A deep learning-based approach for time series forecasting using various neural network architectures, including DNNs, CNNs, RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs. This repository demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate models on real-world datasets, such as long-term temperature data, for accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Multiple Architectures**: Includes DNNs, CNNs, and recurrent models like RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs for time series forecasting.
- **Real-world Data**: Utilizes historical temperature data to predict future values.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Demonstrates how to fine-tune models for improved performance.
- **Visualization**: Plots predicted vs. actual values over time to evaluate model accuracy.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the required dependencies:
